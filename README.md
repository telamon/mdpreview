mdpreview
=========

A simple GTK-based Markdown previewer, designed to be used with an external
editor.

There are many Markdown previewers. `mdpreview` has been written to be as **easy
to use with an external editor** as possible. Just open `mdpreview`, open your
editor and start editing. `mdpreview` will automatically reload when the file
changes, detect when you're viewing the bottom of the document and
automatically scroll down on new content, and more.

It includes themes that closely resemble *github*, and *bitbucket*.
